The templating engine that flask uses is jinja-2, allows us to write code in our tempplates.
we can write a for loop within a code block in the html file like:
starts "   {%for i in lis               %}
           {% endfor                %}
		   
using template inheritance in order to not repeat code 
using wt form features of flask to make a login user page 	
string field (username) will be imported from wt forms package which also installed on installing flask_wtf package

we need a secret key for our application that will protect against modifying cookies and cross-site request forgery attacks
